# scala-view examples - ScalaFX examples

## A collection of examples illustrating use of the scala-view library - using the new, recommended ScalaFX API

This directory contains a collection of examples illustrating the use of the [scala-view](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-view) library. You can run these examples by running `sbt` from this directory and typing `run` at the `sbt` prompt. Then select the example you want to run.

Current examples:

* [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) Gibbs sampling MCMC simulation (parallelised)
* [Heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) Numerical solution of the heat equation, or equivalently, Gaussian blurring of a noisy image

These are examples for the new ScalaFX-based API. Examples for the legacy Swing API are in a separate [examples directory](../examples-swing/).
